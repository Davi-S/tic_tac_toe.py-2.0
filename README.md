## About The Project

From the creators of Chess (may not)... It's coming... Tic-to-Tac 2.0!
As the original developers (ancient egyptians) abandoned the project and didn't give us an update for about {2022 - (-1300)} years, I decided to implement some new features by myself on the E-version of the game.

Here is some of the new and upcoming features of the game:
* Wider board.
No more 3x3 boring board, now you can play on a board the size of your monitor with as many squares as you want.
(The size of a square should not be smaller than 3x3 pixels)

* No player limit.
Now you can play with more than two people! No more people waiting in line to play.
(Calm down, you can still play against the computer if you don't have friends)

* More game modes.
Now you can play in:
-teams play
-every man for himself
-multiple games at once
-quickmatch
-puzzes
-and more!

This project is still in development.

Of course, not all features are available yet. But we (only me) are working (weekends only) to make updates available as soon as possible.

If you have thanks, complaints, bugs to report or want to help with development, just contact me.

The GUI is just the terminal for a while.
